to do 


what should the default page be?
maybe better if there is no default page?
this makes it more flexible but a little less simple
even less simple would be to have a conductor page, that sets the default pages for performers and audience...  mabye nice..
for example, users could request the page via websocket, and the conductor page would respond with the file links. this woudl require that the conductor page is always running.

Another non-number constraint is the deviceId constraint. 
If you have a deviceId from mediaDevices.enumerateDevices(), 
you can use it to request a specific device:

{ video: { deviceId: myPreferredCameraDeviceId } }
